# Supervised Learning Methods with R
Throughout my Data Science journey, Iâ€™ve completed numerous mini-projects in R applying supervised learning techniques to real-world and synthetic datasets. These projects strengthened my ability to preprocess data, apply models, and interpret results effectively.

Skills:

Data Preprocessing, Classification, Regression, Model Evaluation, Visualization

Dataset:

Varies by project

Methodology:
- Preprocess and clean datasets
- Split data into training and testing sets
- Apply supervised machine learning algorithms
- Evaluate model performance and visualize results

Tools & Technologies:
- Programming Language: R
- Libraries: ggplot2, randomForest, glmnet, leaps, neuralnet, rpart, caret, MASS, factoextra, class
- Software: R-Studio, Markdown

Challenges & Learning:

Working across diverse datasets and algorithms taught me how to tailor preprocessing steps and model selection to specific problems. I also became proficient in visualizing model results, diagnosing overfitting, and tuning hyperparameters for better performance.
